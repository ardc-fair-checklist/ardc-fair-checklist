# FAIR software checklist

An interactive checklist with questions about FAIRness of research software. The software checklist yields a badge that project owners can put in their README to communicate the project status to visitors. Clicking on the badge takes you back to the checklist that generated it, and restores the state of each question to how the project owners had filled it in.

The checklist yields hyperlinked badges like this one:

[![FAIR checklist badge](https://fairsoftwarechecklist.net/badge.svg)](https://fairsoftwarechecklist.net/v0.2?f=11&a=11111&i=11111&r=111)

Here's what the corresponding Markdown looks like for that badge:

```markdown
[![FAIR checklist badge](https://fairsoftwarechecklist.net/badge.svg)](https://fairsoftwarechecklist.net/v0.2?f=11&a=11111&i=11111&r=111)
```

The app state should be restored to have the second answer for each question selected.
